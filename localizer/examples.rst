Here is a list of multilingual web sites that use Localizer. If you've used
Localizer to build a web site or to develop a multilingual Python product or
for something else, please tell me, send me a url if it's public and a short
explanation of how you used Localizer or your experience with it, and I'll
include it on the list.

* `LLEU <http://lleu2001.uji.es/>`_

    I developed Localizer to build this web site, it included workflow for
    multilingual documents and an automatic translation system to aid human
    translators.

* `Code&Syntax <http://www.codesyntax.com/>`_

    Code&Syntax is a Zope company specialized in internationalization and
    localization. They're the Localizer users number 1, and have provided me
    very valuable feedback. Other multilingual web sites based on Localizer of
    this company are:

    + `Udal Euskaltegiak <http://www.udaleuskaltegiak.net/>`_
    + `Egoibarra <http://www.egoibarra.com/>`_
